<p style="margin-top:40px;">The United States has re-dispatched its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula in a tit-for-tat action to North Korea’s longest-range missile launch, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday.The US Navy’s USS Ronald Reagan, a 100,000-ton nuclear-powered supercarrier, and its strike group were deployed in the international waters of the East Sea as of Wednesday.The redeployment of the key US strategic asset near the peninsula is the allies’ swift and rare countermove to North Korea’s launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile that flew over Japan and was believed to have splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday morning.</p>
